# Getting MEAN application code

This is the code for the sample 'Loc8r' application that is built through the course of my book [Getting MEAN](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-mean-with-mongo-express-angular-and-node).

Getting MEAN is published by Manning, and teaches readers how to develop web applications end-to-end using the MEAN stack.

## The application at various stages



## Get the code

To get the code for a specific branch:

`$ git clone -b branch-name https://github.com/simonholmes/getting-MEAN.git`

Then change into the folder the git clone command will create:

`$ cd getting-MEAN`

And finally install the dependencies:

`npm install`
